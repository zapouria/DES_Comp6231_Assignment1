Distributed Event Management System (DEMS) using Java RMI

In this assignment, we implemented a distributed event management system (DEMS) for a leading corporate event management company: a distributed system used by event managers who manage the information about the events and customers who can book or cancel an event across the companyâ€™s different branches.
Managers are allowed to perform some functions such as: addEvent, removeEvent, listEventAvailability.
Additionally customers are allowed to perform some functions such as: bookEvent, getBookingSchedule , cancelEvent.
We have 3 servers, Montreal, Quebec and Sherbrook. Therefore, we have one class for implementation of servers and we instantiate each of servers, and pass the required parameters for running the servers through the constructor.
